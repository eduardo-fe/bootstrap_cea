abstract = {A random sample drawn from a population would appear to offer an ideal opportunity to use the bootstrap in order to perform accurate inference, since the observations of the sample are IID. In this paper, Monte Carlo results suggest that bootstrapping a commonly used index of inequality leads to inference that is not accurate even in very large samples, although inference with poverty indices is satisfactory. We find that the major cause is the extreme sensitivity of many inequality indices to the exact nature of the upper tail of the income distribution. This leads us to study two non-standard bootstraps, the m out of n bootstrap, which is valid in some situations where the standard bootstrap fails, and a bootstrap in which the upper tail is modelled parametrically. Monte Carlo results suggest that accurate inference can be achieved with this last method in moderately large samples.}

The Pareto function fits the data fairly well towards the higher levels but the fit is poor towards the lower income levels. The lognormal fits the lower income levels better but its fit towards the upper end is far from satisfactory. There have been other distributions suggested by Champernowne, Rutherford, and others, but even these do not result in any considerable improvement. The present paper derives a distribution that is a generalization of the Pareto distribution and the Weibull distribution used in analyses of equipment failures.

While for these data the beta of the second kind (B2) distribution and generalised gamma (GG) distribution outperform the GB2, our results illustrate that the GB2 can be used as a device for choosing among competing parametric distributions for healthcare cost data.

Several mathematical and statistical properties of this distribution (such as quantiles, moments, moment generating function, hazard rate, mean residual lifetime, mean deviation about mean and median, Bonferroni and Lorenz curves and various entropies) are derived. We establish relations for the single and product moments of generalized order statistics from the Singh–Maddala distribution and then we use these results to compute the first four moments and variance of order statistics and record values for sample different sizes for various values of the shape and scale parameters. For this distribution, two characterizing results based on conditional moments of generalized order statistics and recurrence relations for single moments are established. The method of maximum likelihood is adopted for estimating the unknown parameters. For different parameters settings and sample sizes, the various simulation studies are performed and compared to the performance of the Singh–Maddala distribution. An application of the model to a real data set is presented and compared with the fit attained by some other well-known two and three parameters distributions.},

abstract = {I determine UK income inequality levels and trends by combining inequality estimates from tax return data (for the ‘rich’) and household survey data (for the ‘non-rich’), taking advantage of the better coverage of top incomes in tax return data (which I demonstrate) and creating income variables in the survey data with the same definitions as in the tax data to enhance comparability. For top income recipients, I estimate inequality and mean income by fitting Pareto models to the tax data, examining specification issues in depth, notably whether to use Pareto I or Pareto II (generalized Pareto) models, and the choice of income threshold above which the Pareto models apply. The preferred specification is a Pareto II model with a threshold set at the 99th or 95th percentile (depending on year). Conclusions about aggregate UK inequality trends since the mid-1990s are robust to the way in which tax data are employed. The Gini coefficient for individual gross income rose by around 7\% or 8\% between 1996/7 and 2007/8, with most of the increase occurring after 2003/4. The corresponding estimate based wholly on the survey data is around −5\%.},

Yet, the appeal of this criterion, which requires considering Lorenz curves in their entirety, is undermined by the practical problem that many sample Lorenz curves intersect in the tails. The commonly used inferential methods, based on central limit theorem arguments, do not apply to the tails since these contain too few observations. By contrast, we propose a test procedure for distributions whose tails lie in the domain of attraction of the Fréchet distribution, which fully takes into account the tail behaviour of Lorenz curves. Our experiments and empirical examples demonstrate the good performance of the proposed test: in many cases we are able to infer that despite sample tail crossings the population Lorenz curves do, in fact, exhibit Lorenz dominance.}

While both the standard asymptotic method based on the normal approximation and Efron's bootstrap are inconsistent when the underlying distribution does not possess a second moment, we propose two approaches based on the subsampling idea of Politis and Romano (1994) which will give correct answers. The first approach uses the fact that the sample mean, properly standardized, will under some regularity conditions have a limiting stable distribution. The second approach consists of subsampling the usual t-statistic and is somewhat more general. A simulation study compares the small sample performance of the two methods.},

 abstract = {We establish necessary and sufficient conditions for convergence of the distribution function of a bootstrapped mean, suitably normalized. It turns out that for convergence to occur, the sampling distribution must either be in the domain of attraction of the normal distribution or have slowly varying tails. In the first case the limit is normal; in the latter, Poisson. Between these two extremes of light tails and extremely heavy tails, the bootstrap distribution function of the mean does not converge in probability to a nondegenerate limit. However, it may converge in distribution. We show that when there is no convergence in probability, a small number of extreme sample values determine behaviour of the bootstrap distribution function. This result is developed and used to interpret recent work of Athreya.},

Moreover, the limiting bootstrap distribution is random and unknown. The conventional remedy for this problem, at least asymptotically, is either the m out of n bootstrap or subsampling. However, we show that both these procedures can be unreliable in other than very large samples. We introduce a parametric bootstrap that overcomes the failure of Efron's bootstrap and performs better than the m out of n bootstrap and subsampling. The quality of inference based on the parametric bootstrap is examined in a simulation study, and is found to be satisfactory with heavy-tailed distributions unless the tail index is close to 1 and the distribution is heavily skewed.},

These include financial time series, which can be particularly heavy tailed. However, little is known about properties of ARCH or GARCH models in the heavy-tailed setting, and no methods are available for approximating the distributions of parameter estimators there. In this paper we show that, for heavy-tailed errors, the asymptotic distributions of quasi-maximum likelihood parameter estimators in ARCH and GARCH models are nonnormal, and are particularly difficult to estimate directly using standard parametric methods. Standard bootstrap methods also fail to produce consistent estimators. To overcome these problems we develop percentile-t, subsample bootstrap approximations to estimator distributions. Studentizing is employed to approximate scale, and the subsample bootstrap is used to estimate shape. The good performance of this approach is demonstrated both theoretically and numerically.},

The method is extended to cover nonlinear parameters, regression M-estimators, nonlinear regression and generalized linear models. Interval estimators can be constructed from the jackknife histogram. Three bootstrap methods are considered. Two are shown to give biased variance estimators and one does not have the bias-robustness property enjoyed by the weighted delete-one jackknife.

We state conditions under which asymptotic and bootstrap tests and confidence intervals are asymptotically valid. These conditions put limits on the rates at which the cluster sizes can increase as the number of clusters tends to infinity. We also derive Edgeworth expansions for the asymptotic and bootstrap test statistics. Simulation experiments illustrate the theoretical results and suggest that alternative variants of the wild cluster bootstrap may perform quite differently. The Edgeworth expansions explain the overrejection of asymptotic tests and shed light on the choice of auxiliary distribution and whether to use restricted or unrestricted estimates in the bootstrap data-generating process.},

	abstract = {Researchers have increasingly realized the need to account for within-group dependence in estimating standard errors of regression parameter estimates. The usual solution is to calculate cluster-robust standard errors that permit heteroskedasticity and within-cluster error correlation, but presume that the number of clusters is large. Standard asymptotic tests can over-reject, however, with few (five to thirty) clusters. We investigate inference using cluster bootstrap-t procedures that provide asymptotic refinement. These procedures are evaluated using Monte Carlos, including the example of Bertrand, Duflo, and Mullainathan (2004). Rejection rates of 10\% using standard methods can be reduced to the nominal size of 5\% using our methods.},

 abstract = {An instrument or instrumental variable manipulates a treatment and affects the outcome only indirectly through its manipulation of the treatment. For instance, encouragement to exercise might increase cardiovascular fitness, but only indirectly to the extent that it increases exercise. If instrument levels are randomly assigned to individuals, then the instrument may permit consistent estimation of the effects caused by the treatment, even though the treatment assignment itself is far from random. For instance, one can conduct a randomized experiment assigning some subjects to 'encouragement to exercise' and others to 'no encouragement' but, for reasons of habit or taste, some subjects will not exercise when encouraged and others will exercise without encouragement; none-the-less, such an instrument aids in estimating the effect of exercise. Instruments that are weak, i.e. instruments that have only a slight effect on the treatment, present inferential problems. We evaluate a recent proposal for permutation inference with an instrumental variable in four ways: using Angrist and Krueger's data on the effects of education on earnings using quarter of birth as an instrument, following Bound, Jaeger and Baker in using simulated independent observations in place of the instrument in Angrist and Krueger's data, using entirely simulated data in which correct answers are known and finally using statistical theory to show that only permutation inferences maintain correct coverage rates. The permutation inferences perform well in both easy and hard cases, with weak instruments, as well as with long-tailed responses.},

	abstract = {Inference using difference-in-differences with clustered data requires care. Previous research has shown that, when there are few treated clusters, t-tests based on cluster-robust variance estimators (CRVEs) severely overreject, and different variants of the wild cluster bootstrap can either overreject or underreject dramatically. We study two randomization inference (RI) procedures. A procedure based on estimated coefficients may be unreliable when clusters are heterogeneous. A procedure based on t-statistics typically performs better (although by no means perfectly) under the null, but at the cost of some power loss. An empirical example demonstrates that RI procedures can yield inferences that differ dramatically from those of other methods.},

It is not required to assume any global form for the distribution function, but merely the form of behavior in the tail where it is desired to draw inference. Results are particularly simple for distributions of the Zipf type, i.e., where G(y) = 1 - Cy-α for large y. The methods of inference are based upon an evaluation of the conditional likelihood for the parameters describing the tail behavior, given the values of the extreme order statistics, and can be implemented from both Bayesian and frequentist viewpoints.},
